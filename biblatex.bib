  abstract = {The steel grade DP1000 is widely used in various industrial application fields. Its mechanical properties satisfy basic requirements in terms of strength and global formability due to the tailored microstructure composed of ductile ferrite and hard martensite. Nevertheless, the edge crack sensitivity of dual‐phase steels is still of interest. For its evaluation, hole expansion tests have become a standard experimental approach. Finite element simulation is a tool that further supports the assessment of edge crack resistance by providing insights into local stress and strain fields at the formed edges during hole expansion tests. However, there are still discrepancies between the experiments and simulations in terms of force–displacement curves and hole expansion ratios due to several factors including the hole edge surface condition. To overcome these discrepancies, this work proposes a 3D multiscale simulation strategy to quantify this factor under a complex loading case and to include it into the simulation approaches. The workflow is sufficiently general to handle arbitrary load cases. Compared with state‐of‐the‐art ductile damage mechanics simulations, the accuracy of the simulations is significantly improved.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Experimental and numerical investigations on the description of cold formability of extra abrasion-resistant steel considering surface roughness effects were performed in this study. A novel multiscale numerical approach to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of surface roughness on the cold formability/bendability of heavy plates was proposed and verified. The macroscopic ductile damage behavior of the investigated steel was described by a hybrid damage mechanics model, whose parameters were calibrated by notched round-bar (NRB) tensile tests and single-edge notched bending (SENB) tests. The surface roughness was characterized by confocal microscopy and statistically incorporated into a two-dimensional representative volume element (RVE) model. For the assessment of the bendability of heavy plates in the component level, the critical ratio between the punch radius and the sample thickness               r               /               t               in three-point bending tests was predicted and compared with experimental results. After the surface roughness effects were taken into consideration, a significant improvement in the predicted results was achieved. A good match between the simulation and experimental results confirmed the indispensable influences of surface roughness on the bendability of steels and validated the efficiency of the multiscale simulation approach in the quantitative description of surface roughness affected ductile damage evolutions.},
