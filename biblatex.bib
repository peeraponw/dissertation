  abstract = {Abstract. Pipes applied to marine plants are used in deep-sea environments; therefore, they must be resistant to high pressure and corrosion. Because it is difficult to satisfy both of these factors in a single pipe, studies on a double-layered pipe are continuously being performed. An outer pipe should be made of carbon steel, with high pressure resistance, and an inner pipe should be made of stainless steel, with high corrosion resistance. A pipe formed by combining these two pipes is called a lined pipe. The shear strength of the lined pipe is an important factor because pipe cracking can occur due to stress concentration when two pipes are separated by bending or high pressure. Therefore, various processes have been applied to increase the shear strength. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the surface roughness of the bonding interface on the shear strength. Surface roughness is in units of micrometers, and it cannot be used for finite element method (FEM) analysis. Therefore, surface roughness should be converted into a friction coefficient to perform FEM analysis. The effect of surface roughness on shear strength was studied in the relationship between the results of pressure from FEM analysis and the shear strength test.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This article comprehensively reviews the mechanical properties and tribo-metallurgical behavior of 17-4 precipitation hardening stainless steel (17-4PH SS) during and after cold plastic deformation. Referring to the scientific literature, stainless steels are one of the few types of ferrous alloys which could be appropriately set up through cold working processes in the forms of sheets or other shapes. Likewise, some other metal alloys such as mild low-carbon-based steels, copper and its alloys, aluminum alloys, and some others are the few types of metal alloys which have this capability. On the other hand, in engineering applications, there are several types of mechanical failures, which must be taken into account to investigate the mechanical behavior and tribo-metallurgical properties of any targeted materials. For example, corrosion resistance, wear resistance, and fatigue failure are investigated according to the microstructural studies, comprising of the grain size, grain boundaries, orientations, dislocations, and so on. Based on the published results, focusing on 17-4PH SS, one of the most main effective factors on mechanical and tribo-metallurgical performance is the grain size. Also, the favorable balance of two mechanical properties of strength and ductility has been reported as a dilemma in the materials science, and the problem delineates upon the limitations of numerous structural materials potentials. Following the failure analysis of the materials, in order to diminish the damages caused by fretting fatigue some methods such as ultrasonic processes are applied for the treatment of 17-4PH SS via changing the microstructure, residual stress, and other parameters. Also, through the other cold deformation technologies, the nanostructured surface layer with highly upgraded mechanical properties of several ultrasonic surface rolling process-treated 17-4PH SS has been obtained. To this end, such cold working processes on 17-4PH SS and their subsequent results are elaborated in this review paper.                            Graphical abstract},

  abstract = {Abstract             Milling of granite surface is getting increasingly important in the industry. A major problem is that the effect of granite minerals on surface roughness is currently unknown. The research in this article aims to examine these effects. During the experiment, six surfaces with different cutting speeds were examined on the surface of three different granite samples. The color of the various minerals was determined by light microscopy, and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD) were used to analyze the composition of the samples, and a confocal microscope was used to measure the surface roughness of each mineral. From the results of the investigations, we deduced different correlations between the minerals forming granite and the surface roughness. Area-based surface roughness was used in this study because it results more accurate data. From the results, we conclude that the roughness of different surface-forming minerals varies greatly. This causes a high average surface roughness value.},

  abstract = {Purpose               The purpose of this paper is to study formability, tensile properties, dislocation density and surface roughness of incrementally deformed Ti–6Al–4V alloy sheets during single-point incremental forming (SPIF) and multi-point incremental forming (MPIF) process. The development of corrosion pits in 3.5\% NaCl solution has also been studied during SPIF and MPIF processes.                                         Design/methodology/approach               In this study, the formability, tensile properties, dislocation density, surface roughness and corrosion behaviour of deformed Ti–6Al–4V alloy sheets were studied. A potentio-dynamic polarization (PDP) study was conducted to study the corrosion behaviour of Ti–6Al–4V alloy samples during SPIF and MPIF processes and the results were also compared with base material (BM) in 3.5\% NaCl solution. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were carried out to study the corrosion morphology and dislocation densities of deformed samples.                                         Findings               The deformed Ti–6Al–4V alloy sheets obtained higher plastic deformation, high tensile strength, good surface roughness and good corrosion resistance during MPIF process when compared with SPIF process.                                         Research limitations/implications               It has been concluded that the maximum strain and good corrosion resistance have been achieved with MPIF process, which in turn increases the plastic deformation as compared with BM.                                         Practical implications               This study discussed the formability, tensile properties, surface roughness and corrosion behaviour of deformed Ti–6Al –4V alloy sheets during incremental sheet forming (ISF) process.                                         Social implications               This study is useful in the field of medical, industrial and automobile applications.                                         Originality/value               The Ti–6Al–4V alloy is deformed using MPIF process, achieving better formability, tensile strength, good surface roughness and corrosion rate, and the same is evidenced in forming limit diagrams (FLDs) and PDP curves.},

  abstract = {The steel grade DP1000 is widely used in various industrial application fields. Its mechanical properties satisfy basic requirements in terms of strength and global formability due to the tailored microstructure composed of ductile ferrite and hard martensite. Nevertheless, the edge crack sensitivity of dual‐phase steels is still of interest. For its evaluation, hole expansion tests have become a standard experimental approach. Finite element simulation is a tool that further supports the assessment of edge crack resistance by providing insights into local stress and strain fields at the formed edges during hole expansion tests. However, there are still discrepancies between the experiments and simulations in terms of force–displacement curves and hole expansion ratios due to several factors including the hole edge surface condition. To overcome these discrepancies, this work proposes a 3D multiscale simulation strategy to quantify this factor under a complex loading case and to include it into the simulation approaches. The workflow is sufficiently general to handle arbitrary load cases. Compared with state‐of‐the‐art ductile damage mechanics simulations, the accuracy of the simulations is significantly improved.},

A novel multiscale numerical approach to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of surface roughness on the cold formability/bendability of heavy plates was proposed and verified. The macroscopic ductile damage behavior of the investigated steel was described by a hybrid damage mechanics model, whose parameters were calibrated by notched round-bar (NRB) tensile tests and single-edge notched bending (SENB) tests. The surface roughness was characterized by confocal microscopy and statistically incorporated into a two-dimensional representative volume element (RVE) model. For the assessment of the bendability of heavy plates in the component level, the critical ratio between the punch radius and the sample thickness               r               /               t               in three-point bending tests was predicted and compared with experimental results. After the surface roughness effects were taken into consideration, a significant improvement in the predicted results was achieved. A good match between the simulation and experimental results confirmed the indispensable influences of surface roughness on the bendability of steels and validated the efficiency of the multiscale simulation approach in the quantitative description of surface roughness affected ductile damage evolutions.},
